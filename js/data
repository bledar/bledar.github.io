Today, I have my own job and proud of it at ATIS Shpk where I develop different purpose web applications. And I do start it from scratch, mostly working alone or in teams. Yet, designing tools remain my best friends: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and After Effects - we spend most of the time together and we know each-other closely.",
